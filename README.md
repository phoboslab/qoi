# QOI - The “Quite OK Image Format” for fast, lossless image compression

Single-file MIT licensed library for C/C++

See [qoi.h](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/master/qoi.h) for
the documentation and format specification.

More info at https://qoiformat.org


## Why?

Compared to stb_image and stb_image_write QOI offers 20x-50x faster encoding,
3x-4x faster decoding and 20% better compression. It's also stupidly simple and
fits in about 300 lines of C.


## Example Usage

- [qoiconv.c](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/master/qoiconv.c)
converts between png <> qoi
 - [qoibench.c](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/master/qoibench.c)
a simple wrapper to benchmark stbi, libpng and qoi


## Limitations

The QOI file format allows for huge images with up to 18 exa-pixels. A streaming 
en-/decoder can handle these with minimal RAM requirements, assuming there is 
enough storage space.

This particular implementation of QOI however is limited to images with a 
maximum size of 400 million pixels. It will safely refuse to en-/decode anything
larger than that. This is not a streaming en-/decoder. It loads the whole image
file into RAM before doing any work and is not extensively optimized for 
performance (but it's still very fast).

If this is a limitation for your use case, please look into any of the other 
implementations listed below.

## QOI Support in Other Software

- [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) supports decoding QOI system wide through a custom [cpp implementation in LibGfx](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/Userland/Libraries/LibGfx/QOILoader.h)
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) supports decoding and encoding QOI textures through its [rtextures module](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rtextures.c)
- [Rebol3](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/issues/39) supports decoding and encoding QOI using a native codec
- [c-ray](https://github.com/vkoskiv/c-ray) supports QOI natively


## Packages

[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/qoi-git/) - system-wide qoi.h, qoiconv and qoibench install as split packages.


## Implementations not yet conforming to the final specification

These implementations are based on the pre-release version of QOI. Resulting files are not compatible with the current version.
